#Image Carousel

An image carousel that contains arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backward.
Automatically move forward every 5 seconds.
Contain a little navigation circles at the bottom that indicates which slide you are on (and they should be clickable to advance to that particular slide).

Typically, they consist of a div that acts as the “picture frame”,
where behind that div, there is another much wider div containing the carousel’s images.
This strip of images can then move behind the picture frame, showing a different image depending on what part of the strip is visible.
Any additional controls or features can then be placed on top of the entire thing.
